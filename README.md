# Hacker's Delight

Implementations from the book "Hacker's Delight" 2nd Edition by Henry S. Warren, Jr.

## The book - [Hacker's Delight 2nd Edition](https://a.co/d/bBxyiJj)

> In Hacker’s Delight, Second Edition, Hank Warren once again compiles an irresistible collection of programming hacks: timesaving techniques, algorithms, and tricks that help programmers build more elegant and efficient software, while also gaining deeper insights into their craft.
> Warren’s hacks are eminently practical, but they’re also intrinsically interesting, and sometimes unexpected, much like the solution to a great puzzle. They are, in a word, a delight to any programmer who is excited by the opportunity to improve.
